# CookieCraft

A Minecraft modpack with the goal of improving the player's experience without too many mods.
Despite the small amount of mods, CookieCraft features improved preference, quality of life changes, technical mods, and more.

## Forking

Another core goal of this pack is to be easily maintainable.
If you don't like the default configs, simply fork it!
It even comes with a permissive license, so you are free to do **whatever** you'd like with the modpack.

For more about how to fork and maintain the modpack, please read our [docs](./docs/).[^1]
